# Camera-Calibration---fisheye-effect-removal
Camera calibration is a technique used in multiple applications. in this project I used it to calculate the camera matrix (rotational and transitional parameters of the camera) to generate linear view of the monitored are and then enable us from performing further operations on the captured image.  
The repository is made up of 2 files: 1st generating the camera matrix and applying the unistorting operation on a single image
the 2nd is capturing images in a successive sequence as multiple number of chess-board images are required to calculate the camera matrix
